# xframework
Modular CoD4 and partially generic multi hack framework

Note that the menu's colors are pretty(quite) bad in this version, and some of the spacing/placement as well.
This source is mainly meant to be used as a reference, although it really isn't that hard to fix the menu if 
you have the brains. Another known bug is that the Auto Fire doesn't work, but the aimbot seems pretty
 spot on, although I haven't been able to test in an actual online match. The other ports are all incomplete, but I may end up uploading some/part of them one of these days.
 
 Credits once again go to UC, GD, numerous individuals, and just cool in general dudes. Thank you all, and enjoy.
